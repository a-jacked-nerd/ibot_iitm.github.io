    <div class="panel">
      <p>In an age where intelligent robots are becoming increasingly relevant, Project GRASP aims to explore and
        experiment with robotic foundation models for visuomotor policies in general-purpose robotic manipulation. The
        team is building simulated and real-world setups for single-arm pick-and-place tasks, using cutting-edge AI to
        develop end-to-end learning workflows. This not only allows for scalable, adaptable robotic control but also
        offers hands-on exposure to frontier tech, making it a career-boosting learning ground in AI-driven robotics.
